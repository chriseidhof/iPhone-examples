iPhone Examples
==============

This repository contains some really basic examples for iPhone programming.
Every example tries to show one or two basic iPhone patterns.
I plan to add more simple things to it, but feel free to fork and improve!

Samples
--------

* Browser2:     a simple web-browser with favorites support
* Calculator:   a simple calculator
* ChordFinder:  displays guitar chords and allows for adding of new chords.
* CoreMotion:   how to access CoreMotion data and move a block based on the device rotation
* Notes:        a simple application that displays a full-screen UITextView which resizes once the keyboard appears.
